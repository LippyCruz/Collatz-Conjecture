# Collatz-Conjecture
A videogame based on the collatz conjecture mathematical problem. 

The main idea is to create a videogame where each room is assigned a number, but only the room with the number 1 is the last one. The player chooses a random number, where the puzzles will be procedurally generated based on that number, and then, the next room is chosen based on the collatz formula, where if the current room's number is even, divide that number by two, but if the number is odd, multiply by three and add 1.

Room (even number): Room/2

Room (odd number): (Room * 3) + 1
